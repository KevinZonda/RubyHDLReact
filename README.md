# Online Ruby Compiler (ORC)

Live at [ruby.kevinzonda.com](https://ruby.kevinzonda.com/)

Online Ruby Compiler (ORC) is a web-based tool that allows you to compile and run Ruby HDL code in real-time. ORC relies on a backend service which compiles the code and returns the result.

Ruby HDL is a DSL for describing digital circuits. See more at [Ruby HDL and (Imperial) Ruby Compiler](https://github.com/KevinNote/ruby-hdl).

ORC relies on its backend [KevinNote/RubyHDLWeb](https://github.com/KevinNote/RubyHDLWeb) to support compiling and running Ruby codes. The backend now is deployed as a docker container.
